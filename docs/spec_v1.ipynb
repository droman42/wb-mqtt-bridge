    "Here is the key idea. I want to create a service in python (either a linux system service or hosted as a web service), which would be a mqtt client, managing a series of devices. For each device there would be a list of MQTT topics, to which a client is supposed to listen or publish. For each event a listener should call a device specific function, which would origin from a device specific python library. So, it might be a good idea to create an individual python file. The MQTT library to be used is this one: https://github.com/AndreasHeine/asyncio-mqtt/tree/main\n",

    "You need to suggest, how the mentioned mqtt library should be used and how the project architecture should look like. Come back to me with questions, which you might have"

    "Here are some key questions before I draft the specification:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Deployment Preference:**  \n",
    "   - Should it be a **systemd Linux service** or a **standalone web service**?  \n",
    "   - If a web service, should it have an API for external interaction?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Device Management:**  \n",
    "   - Will devices be dynamically discovered, or do you want a predefined config file with device details?  \n",
    "   - Should device configurations (MQTT topics, function mappings) be stored in **JSON/YAML/TOML**, a database, or hardcoded in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Device-Specific Logic:**  \n",
    "   - How do you want to handle device functions? Should each device have its own Python module (e.g., `device_name.py`), or a single dispatcher module?  \n",
    "   - Should we use a **plugin-like system** where new devices can be added dynamically?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Error Handling & Logging:**  \n",
    "   - Should logs be stored in a file, sent to a logging service, or printed to stdout?  \n",
    "   - Should errors trigger retries, alerts, or just be logged?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Scalability & Concurrency:**  \n",
    "   - Do we expect a **high number of MQTT messages**? If so, should we use an event queue (like Redis, Kafka) for processing?  \n",
    "   - Is multi-threading or multiprocessing needed, or should everything stay async?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Security & Authentication:**  \n",
    "   - Will the MQTT broker require authentication (username/password, SSL/TLS)?  \n",
    "   - Should devices have access control rules (who can publish/subscribe to what)?\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Configuration Management:**  \n",
    "   - Should the MQTT topics & devices be configurable via an API, a config file, or environment variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you clarify these points, I can structure a solid specification for you! ðŸš€"
