# The following packages are handled specially in the Dockerfile for ARM compatibility:
#
# cryptography - Uses PiWheels or a compatible version for ARM
# broadlink - Depends on cryptography, installed after cryptography is properly installed
#
# These are not included directly here to avoid build issues on ARM
